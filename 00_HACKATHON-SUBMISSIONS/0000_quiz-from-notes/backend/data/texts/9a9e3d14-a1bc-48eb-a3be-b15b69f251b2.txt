Research
Research is the systematic process of reviewing existing knowledge (through literature
such as research papers and journals), identifying gaps or unanswered questions, and
attempting to address these gaps by collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data to
generate new insights or validate existing theories.
Research is a process of systematic inquiry that entails collection of data; documentation
of critical information; and analysis and interpretation of that data/information, in
accordance with suitable methodologies set by specific professional fields and
academic disciplines.
Objectives of Research
The purpose of research is to discover answers to questions through the application of
scientific
procedures. The main aim of research is to find out the truth which is hidden and which
has not been
discovered as yet. Though each research study has its own specific purpose, we may
think of
research objectives as falling into a number of following broad groupings:
• To discover new knowledge and expand the existing body of information.
• To identify gaps in current studies and provide solutions.
• To understand and explain phenomena by finding relationships between
variables.
• To predict future outcomes based on patterns and evidence.
• To apply knowledge in solving real-world problems.
• To support decision-making in academic, industrial, and social contexts.
• To contribute to theory and help in building or refining scientific principles.
